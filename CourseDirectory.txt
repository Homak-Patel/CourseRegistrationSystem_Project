COURSE NAME:International
Economics

COURSE OUTLINE:In the contemporary age of increasing integration among the economies of the world, 
questions such as why and how countries trade with one another, how international capital flows are decided,
how do indigenous firms compete against the mighty multinational corporations, 
the relevance of interest and inflation rate differentials, 
how the international value of currency gets decided, 
and many more, call for the attention of students of Economics. 
Answers to these questions are not simple, 
and there scarcely exists a unique solution for any one of them.
Nevertheless, principles of Economics, both Micro and Macro, 
often provide an interesting and effective framework on which 
the logic of international economic issues can be constructed.
International Economics provides an insight into some of these principles 
and equips undergraduate students in the field of management 
with the understanding of the functioning of the economies in a globalized world.
The course covers essential theories of International Economics as well as empirical analysis of 
some of the most important global events that have altered the way in which economies
have functioned over the last few decades.

COURSE NAME:Probabilistic Graphical Models

COURSE OUTLINE:Probability theory and Graph modelling (PGM) play a key role in the design of a system 
across many disciplines like Artificial Intelligence, statistics, Life Sciences -computational biology,
 Computer Systems, Intelligent Transports, Robotics, Economics etc. Such field treated as ï¿½the search 
for a coherent global conclusion from local information.The PGM framework provides a unified view for this wide 
range of problems, enabling efficient inference, decision-making and learning in problems with a very large number 
of attributes and huge datasets. PGMs bring together graph theory and probability theory and provide a flexible
framework for modelling large collections of random variables with complex interactions.  
The course will focus mainly on three aspects: A. The core representation, 
including Bayesian and Markov networks, and dynamic Bayesian networks; B. Probabilistic inference algorithms, 
both exact and approximate; and C. Learning methods for both the parameters and the structure of graphical models. 
Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, statistics, and algorithms. 
This class will set the foundation for machine learning, predictive analytics, reinforcement learning, natural language processing etc. 
Students can apply PGM in any field of core computer science and engineering to handle multidimensional uncertain problems.

This is a course to introduce the students to different aspects of control for mobile robots.  
How to control them and make them move around safely and effectively. 
They start from the basis and finally will end up with a physical moving robot. 
In this path they will be familiarized with Kinematic and Dynamic of mobile robots, different aspects of robot perception, 
after a review of control theory and systems they will be introduced to hybrid automata and its components. 
They go through the theory behind localization and navigation which will lead them to motion planning, 
after which the practical part of the course will begin.  The robot building will bring up such topics as hardware 
and software used for making a mobile robot and running it.
